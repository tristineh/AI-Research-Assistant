This project aims to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that enables users to ask questions about research documents and receive grounded answers with citations.  The goal is to reduce hallucinations in LLM responses by combining semantic retrieval with generation.

Example Use Case: 
Upload policy papers → ask: “What interventions improved health equity outcomes?”
-> System retrieves relevant passages and generates cited answers.

Future Improvements:
-> reranking models
-> evaluation benchmarks
-> multi-document reasoning
